Matplotlib:
	Matplotlip is a python library, used for Data analysis and data Visualisation.
	
=> Matplot lib is used to visualize the data provided, with visual plots, such as Graph plot,
	Scatter plot, barchart.
=> Here matplotlib is used to format the Crude data, which is provided in .csv files,
	into an appropriate format, for feeding the Data into a Machine learning Model for analysis.

tensorflow:
		tensorflow is a python library used for working with machine learning models.
=>using tensor flow , we import and configur a Machine Learning Model, to analyze the data and predict the Output.

=>first  A Neural Network is built using keras python Library, above the Neural NEtwork the ML Model is run, by feeding the Data, formatted previously.

=> The neural Network is created using a Tensorflow library KERAS
	model = keras.Sequential() => parameters are given inorder to create Neural Network.
	
	model.compile() => to analyze all the Data provided by starting up the Model.
