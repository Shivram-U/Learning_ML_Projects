# Machine Learning

## Overview
This repository was created as part of my journey to learn and apply machine learning techniques. Here, you will find a collection of machine learning models, datasets, and related resources that I've been working on.

## Contents

This repository includes:

- Machine learning models implemented in various programming languages (e.g., Python, R, Julia).
- Datasets used for training and testing these models.
- Jupyter notebooks and code examples demonstrating how to use these models.
- Documentation and explanations for different machine learning concepts and algorithms.
- Supplementary files and resources that support the models and projects.
